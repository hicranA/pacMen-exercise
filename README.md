# pacMen-exercise
## MIT xPro certificate - PacMen Exercise.
In this exercise, we practiced; when "make one" is pressed, positioned the new Pacman image, and added it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of Pacman, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each Pacman and each Pacman bounce off any wall it hits.

Future improvements; I will work on using other pictures to animate Pacman. While it is bouncing.

## Roadmap
The project has image files(four of them), an index.html file, and a pacamensolition.js file. Download these files to a folder on your computer. Drag and drop the index file into your browser. You will see two buttons first, click the start button, then click add Pacman button to add more Pacman.
